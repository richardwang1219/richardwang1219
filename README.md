My name is Richard Wang. I am a Front-End developer based in Los Angeles, California. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I build interactive and responsive websites.

Through my passion and knowledge in web development, I enjoy creating personal projects improving people's daily productivity and quality of life. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring, hiking, and appreciating small things in life.ðŸŒ±
